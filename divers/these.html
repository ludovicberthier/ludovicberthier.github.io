<blockquote> 
We present a theoretical study of the off-equilibrium dynamics 
of a large class of microscopic systems, whose 
common feature is to present, under specific 
experimental conditions, an extremely slow (`glassy') relaxation.

We first tackle the question of aging in glassy systems, 
developing a quantitative comparison between two 
theoretical descriptions, namely (i) domain
growth processes, (ii) analytical solution  
of mean-field disordered spin models.

We next study the case where the dynamics is driven by an external
force. This situation is important for applications 
(rheology of supercooled liquids and complex fluids, slow
compaction of granular materials, etc.), and its systematic
investigation is an original aspect of this work. 

In this context, we first numerically study the effect of a flow 
on the phase separation of a binary mixture. The  
(Temperature, Drive) phase diagram
of structural and spin glasses is then investigated
in the  mean-field approximation.
We consider the two cases of a constant, nonconservative and then 
conservative but time-dependent, driving force.
These studies result in a
microscopic -shape of the relaxation, effective temperature
defined via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem-, and 
macroscopic -flow curves, dynamic phase transition-
description.  
The main results are numerically tested on realistic
models for supercooled liquids and spin glasses.
